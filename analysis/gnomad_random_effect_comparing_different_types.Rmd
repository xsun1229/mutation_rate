# Introduction

An interesting question is whether the hot-spots of different mutation types tend to occur together. To make comparison: 

1. we created plots with the Smash estimates of multiple mutation types together in few regions. 

2. we made a scatter plot of the Smash estimates of the random effects between two mutation types across all windows.
