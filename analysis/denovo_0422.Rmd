# Data Overview

# Models

We partitioned the whole genome into disjoint windows (10kb, 30kb, 50kb, 100kb). 

We denoted the mutation count (summing over all mutation types) in window $i$ as $y_i$, which follows a Poisson distribution 

$$y_i \sim \text{pois}(\mu_i\theta_i)$$
$\mu_i$ the expected mutation count from Roulette.
$\theta_i$ represents additional local variation, is a "random effect"  measuring the departure from the expected rate.

The parameter $\theta_i$ can result from both:
- Non-spatial effects $\theta_i^{NS}$
- Spatial effects $\theta_i^{S}$

Besides, we donate $r_i$ = $y_i$/$\mu_i$ (fold change) as the ratio of observed vs. expected mutations

The window sizes for the local random effects range from hundreds kb to 1mb
